1. Folder name:
	- all leters with lowercase
	- if a name has more than one word, they should be separated with underscore '_'
2. File name for components:
	- Use UpperCanelCase / PascalCase for Components, eg. Breadcrumb.js, UserList.js
	- If a component describes an Action

3. Semicolons in code.
	In javascript using ';' is optional and even compiler add them automatically during the compilation, but still it
	can face with some problems.
	Example:
		a = b + c
		(d + e).print()

	It is preferable to use semicolons.
