Scheduler defines when and what connection should be performed. It has a calendar and a list of schedules. Each schedule consist of a title (required field), a connection (required field), time (required field), a periodicity (required field), and a color. The periodicity can be once, every day, every week and every hour. The color has a default blue value; it is not required. The calendar has different views: Month, Week, Work Week, Day, Agenda. It displays all schedules in relative to the time.

Scheduler consists of three parts: Calendar, Add Schedule and List of Schedules. The calendar has different views: month, week, work week, day, and agenda. You can switch between them clicking on the right button above. In the left part you see today, back, and next. These are navigation buttons. Clicking on the today button you can easily come to the current date. Back and Next bring you to the next month or to the next week or to the next day, depending on the selected view. If you click two times on the calendar, on the concrete date, you will see the opening window, where you can create a new schedule for this time.
Add Schedule has 5 fields: name, connection, time, periodicity, and color. All of them except color are required. The periodicity can be once, every day, every week and every hour. Clicking on **Add** you will create a new schedule.
