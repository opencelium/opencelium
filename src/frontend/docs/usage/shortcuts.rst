**:underline:`We will describe shortcuts with managing users as an example.`

Clicking on the Users menu you will see the list of users with max **4** on one page and a pagination down. Clicking on one of them you will open a description of the user. You can navigate with a keyboard too. Pressing **1** you will select first user of the list, pressing **2** the second one. The same if you press **3** and **4**. After you will see the underlined letters of the words View, Update and Delete. Pressing **P** you will open the description of the user as you would click on it with a mouse. If you want to deselect the element of the list, just press on **Esc** button. Keyboard navigation also works for Update and Delete. You need to select with a number the needed list element and press on **U** and **D** button correspondingly to perform the action. Bottom you can see an option Add User. The letter **A** has an underline, that means that pressing **A** you will open a window to add a new user.
