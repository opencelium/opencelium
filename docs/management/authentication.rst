Authentication
##################

Our application provides multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access:

Local Database
"""""""""""""""""

Users can authenticate via credentials stored in a local database (MySQL). This method requires
users to provide a username and password which are securely hashed and stored in the database.
Only Admin has rights to manage users.

TOTP
"""""""""""""""""

For enhanced security, the app supports Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication.
After entering their username and password, users are required to provide a time-sensitive,
six-digit code generated by an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
This two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism adds an extra layer of protection by verifying
the identity of users beyond their password.

LDAP
"""""""""""""""""

Our app can also integrate with enterprise-level LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
directories for authentication. Users can log in using credentials from a centralized LDAP server,
which allows for easier user management in corporate environments. LDAP provides secure and flexible
authentication, making it ideal for organizations that manage large numbers of users.
To establish the LDAP authentication you need to configure the *application.yml* file.
Under *spring* -> *security*, please, set the required parameters:
ldap:
      # LDAP server URL
      urls: ldap://ldap.forumsys.com:389
      # User search base
      user-search-base: dc=example
      # Group search base
      group-search-base: dc=example
      # LDAP manager credentials
      username: cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com
      password: password
      # Where to search for roles/groups
      group-search-filter: (uniquemember={0})
      # User search filter
      user-search-filter: (uuid={0})
      # Maps groups between ldap and opencelium
      group-role-mapping:
        - ldap-group: ou=mathematicians,dc=example,dc=com
          oc-role: Admin
        - ldap-group: ou=scientists,dc=example,dc=com
          oc-role: User
      default-role: User
      show-logs: true
      timeout: 30000

.. warning::
    After updating the application.yml file, please build and restart the server.

Now you can check the ldap connection


Each of these methods offers robust security features, allowing flexibility in authentication based
on user needs and security policies.
