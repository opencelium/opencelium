OpenCelium -- Open Source API-Hub
==================================================================

OpenCelium easily connects applications for IT operations and IT service management with 
each other so that they can communicate seamlessly and easily exchange data with each 
other - similar to how the mycelia network of mushrooms in the forest floor links the 
trees to form the Wood Wide Web. With OpenCelium, writing and updating API scripts 
becomes a simple drag and drop for the IT administrator on a convenient front end.
