OpenCelium -- Open Source API-Hub
==================================================================

OpenCelium easily connects applications with each other so that they can communicate 
seamlessly and easily exchange data with each other - similar to how the mycelia network 
of mushrooms in the forest floor links the trees to form the Wood Wide Web. With OpenCelium, 
writing and updating API scripts becomes a simple drag and drop for the IT administrator 
on a convenient front end.
